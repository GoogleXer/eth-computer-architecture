==+== A. Paper summary

Bulk data copy and initialization is a frequently used operation 
in today's systems. As many computers have a CPU-centric design,
large amounts of data are unecessarily moved across the memory
channel which degrades system performance and energy efficiency.

This paper presents a novel technique called RowClone that performs
bulk copy and initialization completely in DRAM. RowClone uses the 
row buffer to transfer data within the same subarray and the internal
bus to move data between subarrays or banks. As a result, RowClone
can significantly improve performance and energy consumption with
only minimal changes to the DRAM chip.

==+== B. Strengths

* Simple and elegant mechanism to solve an important problem

* RowClone is intuitive and easy to understand which stimulates 
  adoption

* Although RowClone has some drawbacks for bulk copy, it's a
  clear win for initialization

* The paper describes the implementation of RowClone across
  the complete computing stack

==+== C. Weaknesses

* Data needs to be in the same subarray to get all benefits of
  RowClone

* Inter-subarray copy is inefficient

* Cache coherence is tricky and causes overhead

==+== D. Thoughts and ideas

* Research how to move data on smaller granularity i.e.
  smaller than row size

* Implement RowClone on real system

* Research RowClone like techniques in emerging memory
  techniques e.g. PCM

==+== E. Takeaways

RowClone is a simple and effective mechanism to accelerate bulk
copy and initialization. The paper is also a good example for 
presenting an idea that goes across the entire stack. Many papers
build on RowClone which shows that PIM is a promising research area.
