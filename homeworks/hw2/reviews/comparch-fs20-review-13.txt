==+== A. Paper summary

The performance demands of mobile consumer devices have increased
dramatically in recent years due to emerging applications like 4K 
video streaming or virtual reality (VR). Nevertheless, battery
capacity and thermal power dissipation limit the performance of
these devices so energy consumption is of great importance.

This work analyses the following widely-used Google consumer workloads:

* Chrome Web Browser
* TensorFlow Mobile (Machine Learning Library)
* video playback & capture (VP9 codec)

The authors found that data movement between memory and compute units
is a blocker for performance and energy efficiency.
They proposed processing-in-memory (PIM) using the logic layer in 3D-stacked
memory and showed that this approach significantly reduces total 
energy consumption and execution time of each workload.

==+== B. Strengths

* Very interesting case studies on real world applications which clearly
  show the applicability of PIM

* Moving small functions (PIM targets) to PIM cores/accelerators makes
  implementation easy and encourages reusability

* Simulating these different workloads is very time consuming but the
  results support the claim that data movement is indeed a great 
  bottleneck

* The paper is well structured and easy to read

==+== C. Weaknesses

* The implementation of PIM cores/accelerators was only covered from
  a higher level without many details

* The background section about PIM is very brief so readers without
  extensive knowledge about PIM will have a hard time to understand
  this paper

* System integration is only mentioned briefly although it is the
  main challenge towards widespread adoption of PIM

==+== D. Thoughts and ideas

* The authors could drop a workload or two and cover the implementation of
  another one in more detail

* Implement multiple PIM targets in a simulator and see how if the interfere
  with each other

==+== E. Takeaways

This paper was a very interesting and enjoyable read which clearly shows
that PIM should be considered especially in mobile consumer devices.

==+== F. Other comments

* Typo in section 3.2 line 4 (misplaced the)

==+== Scratchpad (for unsaved private notes)

==+== End Review
