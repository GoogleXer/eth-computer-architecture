==+== A. Paper summary

This paper examined 1580 DRAM chips of different technology nodes for the 
RowHammer vulnerability and the results show that newer DRAM chips are
more vulnerable to RowHammer. The authors explain this trend with the 
increased cell density which increases inference between adjacent rows.

Then they used the collected data to evaluate five state-of-the-art 
mitigation techniques. With simulations they uncovered that existing
protection mechanisms are either not scalable or suffer from a large
performance overhead for more vulnerable chips in the future.

They concluded that more research on effective solutions to RowHammer
is critical.

==+== B. Strengths

* In contrast to prior works this paper provides real data and makes no
  assumptions that newer chips are more vulnerable to RowHammer

* Superior methodology and carefully conducted simulations

* Many interesting plots and observations

==+== C. Weaknesses

* The grouping of the technology nodes (new/old) is somewhat unclear (also
  hard because confidential)

* Certain observations don't support the hypothesis and the authors explain
  these discrepancies with the incorrect classification of the chips. Why
  not fix the classification and see if results are consistent?

==+== D. Thoughts and ideas

* Research refresh based/circuit level mitigation techniques

* Observation 1 shows that the bitflips in manufacturer A's chips are very 
  low. It would be interesting to find the reason for that.

* Research how to effectively implement multi-bit ECC

==+== E. Takeaways

* Good example for rigorous methodology

* RowHammer is not fixed and new DRAM chips become increasingly more vulnerable
  so additional research is vital for secure and reliable systems.

==+== F. Other comments

* Goal of paper is mentioned twice (once in Section 1 and once in Section 3)

* As there is a significant difference between the vulnerability of the tested
  chips it would be useful to publish the manufacturer and exact type of the 
  chips so people can decide which manufacturer/chip they should prefer.

* ProHIT and MRLoc are promising mitigation techniques but they were only
  evaluated for HC=2000. Maybe an exchange with the original authors leads
  to solutions for different HC and to more complete results in the simulation.
