==+== A. Paper summary

The chapter gives a general overview of main memory research. The author
presents current trends on the systems/architecture front and derives new
requirements on the memory system. He concludes that main memory is still
the performance/energy bottleneck and scaling becomes increasingly difficult.

To solve these issues the chapter describes three directions for possible
solutions:

* new DRAM architectures
* new memory technologies
* QoS for the memory system

Every chapter summarizes promising research results and encourages the reader
to come up with his own ideas.

==+== B. Strengths

* The chapter summarizes the problem and research for main memory 
  compactly and serves as a good starting point for future memory
  systems researchers

* The memory system has always been a bottleneck so the challenges addressed
  in this chapter are of great importance

* Many proposed solutions have great potential and show encouraging results 

==+== C. Weaknesses

* Systems/Memory co-design is outlined as a promising approach but only
  a few references are mentioned

* The chapter requires a fair amount of background in the main memory field
  which might be a blocker for an introduction

==+== D. Thoughts and ideas

* Replace the Flash aside with an in-depth introduction to DRAM

* The chapter is from 2015 so it might be a good idea to revise some of
  the concepts and present new ideas

==+== E. Takeaways

* This chapter serves as a great reference for main memory research and
  will be helpful for my further studies

* I'm especially interested in systems/memory co-design which seems to
  have great potential

==+== F. Other comments
