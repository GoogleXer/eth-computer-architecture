==+== A. Paper summary

This paper presents Ramulator, a fast and extensible DRAM simulator. Ramulator
supports many DRAM standards (e.g. DDR3/4, LPDDR3/4, HBM) and some academic
proposals (SALP, AL-DRAM, TL-DRAM). The modular design of Ramulator decouples
the logic for updating the state machines from the details of a particular DRAM
standard. Ramulator is also 2.5x faster than the next fastest simulator. The
combination of extensibility and speed promotes Ramulator as the perfect tool
for future DRAM research.

==+== B. Strengths

* Modular design that is easy to extent

* 2.5x faster than next fastest simulator

* Many DRAM standards supported

* Released under BSD license on GitHub

==+== C. Weaknesses

* The excessive use of C++ templates slows down compilation

* No power consumption model for all standards

==+== D. Thoughts and ideas

* Replace some of the C++ templates with inheritance to make compilation faster

==+== E. Takeaways

This paper helped me to get a head start for the lab because it explained
Ramulator in a concise and interesting way.
