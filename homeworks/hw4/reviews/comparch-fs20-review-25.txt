==+== A. Paper summary

DRAM is experiencing difficult scaling challenges that make it harder to improve
capacity, energy efficiency and reliability. Industry and academia are looking
for alternative memory technologies to either complement DRAM or to replace DRAM
entirely. One promising candidate is Phase Change Memory (PCM), which has great
potential for scalability but also several drawbacks such as long latencies,
high energy writes and finite endurance.

This paper proposes two enhancements to address these drawbacks and make PCM
competitive to DRAM. First, they reorganize the internal buffers such that the
latency gap is 1.2x and the energy gap is 1.0x compared to a DRAM baseline.
Second, they introduce partial write which enhances memory endurance, providing
5.6 years of lifetime. In the conclusion the authors give some pointers to
  exploit the non-volatile characteristics to create completely new
architectures.

==+== B. Strengths

* PCM scales to smaller technology nodes (increases capacity, reduces energy
  consumption)

* PCM is persistent which enables a wide range of applications (e.g. faster boot
  time)

* PCM requires no refresh which reduces idle energy consumption

* Buffer reorganization is easy to implement (area-neutral) and reduces
  latency/energy consumption significantly

* Useful technology survey for further PCM research

* Superior methodology explained in great detail

==+== C. Weaknesses

* worst case lifetime is much shorter for some workloads

* memory intensive applications have a larger performance/energy penalty

* the simulation could be imprecise or the PCM parameters are too optimistic

* hard to understand for a person not familiar with chip manufacturing

==+== D. Thoughts and ideas

* Research other caching policies for PCM buffer

* Explore applications/challenges enabled by persistent main memory

* Reverse engineer Intel Optane Memory

==+== E. Takeaways

PCM is a promising new memory technology which could complement or replace DRAM
in the future. This paper laid the foundation for Intel Optane memory and is
a good example how research ideas is implemented in industry.
