==+== A. Paper summary

The paper identifies three major challenges to scale DRAM below 10nm feature
size:

* Refresh
* write recovery time (tWR)
* variable retention time (VRT)

The authors propose to increase tWR to make DRAM more reliable but then
performance decreases. SALP could be used to mitigate this performance loss.
Reliable writes depend also on temperature so a temperature aware memory
controller could increase tWR only if it's necessary. To solve the VRT and
refresh problems the authors suggest ECC in DRAM.

All these solutions are only possible if the memory controller and DRAM
communicate over a rich interface or are at best co-architected together. In
summary, this paper is a call for intelligent memory controllers.

==+== B. Strengths

* This work is not some academic proposal without any connection to reality but
  people from industry who call for a better integration of the memory
  controller and DRAM

==+== C. Weaknesses

* This paper doesn't make any novel contributions (to be expected from
  a summary)

==+== D. Thoughts and ideas

==+== E. Takeaways

Feature sizes below 10nm are only possible with smart memory controllers.
