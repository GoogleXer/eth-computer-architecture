==+== A. Paper summary

This short essay introduces Amdahl's Law which was used for decades as a upper
bound for parallel computing performance.

==+== B. Strengths

* Predicted many problems in parallel computing which we have today

* Identifies data movement as a major sequential bottleneck which cannot be
  reduced significantly by parallel programming

==+== C. Weaknesses

* Amdahl's Law doesn't consider PIM which could remove the data movement
  bottleneck and speed up parallel computing significantly

* In practice, Amdahl's Law doesn't seemed to be correct because many problems
  in e.g. Deep Learning or climate simulation benefited from many-core systems.

==+== D. Thoughts and ideas

* Reformulate Amdahl's law considering PIM

* Incorporate some characteristics of a problem into Amdahl's law to get tighter
  bounds (e.g. Roofline Model)

==+== E. Takeaways

Running a program on N cores doesn't give you a N-times speedup i.e. single
processor approach is still important.

==+== F. Other comments
