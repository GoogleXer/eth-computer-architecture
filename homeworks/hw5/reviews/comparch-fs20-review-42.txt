==+== A. Paper summary

This short paper defines how a program is correctly executed even if the
microarchitecture uses a different order than specified by the programmer.
Later, this definition is extended to multicore systems which require additional
conditions to guarantee a correct execution i.e. sequential consistency.

==+== B. Strengths

* The paper gives an important definition of correctness which made multi-core
  systems usable

* Illustrative example to understand the gist of the problem

==+== C. Weaknesses

* Requirement R2 is very restrictive and can severely reduce performance

==+== D. Thoughts and ideas

* Develop algorithms that work without sequential consistency to improve
  performance

==+== E. Takeaways

Sequential consistency in a multicore system has more restrictive requirements
so some techniques to speed up single-core machines cannot be employed in
a multicore environment.

==+== F. Other comments
