==+== A. Paper summary

Static and stride prefetchers are effective for structured workloads but are
inefficient for unstructured workloads. One technique to tackle these
unstructured workloads are correlation-based prefetchers.

This paper describes the Markov prefetcher. The prefetcher builds a approximated
Markov model and prioritizes memory requests based on the transition
probability. The basic Markov prefetcher is not always accurate i.e. memory
bandwidth intensive. The paper presents several techniques to reduce the
bandwidth demands of the prefetcher.

The Markov prefetcher provides a good trade-off between coverage, accuracy, and
timeliness, especially in combination with other prefetchers.

==+== B. Strengths

* Strong prefetcher for unstructured workloads

* Markov prefetcher can support e.g. a stride prefetcher by covering the
  irregular workloads

* Excellent description of the experimental setup

==+== C. Weaknesses

* Correlation table has to be large to get accurate predictions

* Markov prefetcher can only prefetch patterns that already occurred

* High memory-bandwidth consumption

* Cannot prefetch compulsory misses

==+== D. Thoughts and ideas

* Pre-train Markov model on common workloads

* Apply statistical methods to get a better representation of the Markov model
  (instead of a simple table)

==+== E. Takeaways

The Markov prefetcher is an efficient approach to prefetch irregular workloads.

==+== F. Other comments

* Fig. 6 is hard to read and understand (use a different color for each prefetch
  configuration would make it more readable)
