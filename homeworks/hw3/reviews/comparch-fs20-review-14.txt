==+== A. Paper summary

This article presents several approaches to accelerate read mapping. As read
mapping is a major bottleneck in the genome sequencing pipeline, improving
the performance of read mapping will lead to faster DNA sequencing. Faster DNA
sequencing enables e.g. rapid surveillance of disease outbreaks (COVID-19).

Read mapping is divided into indexing, pre-alignment filtering and sequence
alignment. The article summarizes several improvements for each step and
concludes with remaining challenges and future opportunities.

==+== B. Strengths

* The article addresses a important problem as read mapping is a huge 
  blocker for fast genome analysis and sequencing a complete genome
  is extremely difficult

* Excellent overview with a quick summary about a technique and valuable
  references for further research

* The article has a good structure and is easy to read

==+== C. Weaknesses

* Despite the title _Accelerating Genome Analysis_ the focus is entirely
  on read mapping which might neglect other acceleration techniques (e.g.
  novel genome assembly techniques)

* Quite some background in computer science is required to understand many 
  concepts which could potentially put off readers from related areas 

==+== D. Thoughts and ideas

* Provide a framework to quickly adapt specialized hardware

* How to design an architecture for a device that combines the sequencer
  and a technique like GenASM?

==+== E. Takeaways

After reading this article I understand why genome sequencing is a hard
problem and what the performance bottleneck is. Many interesting 
approaches exists but I miss a solution that spans across the whole
genome analysis pipeline.

==+== F. Other comments

* In Figure 1 (a) seeds are called k-mers but the text makes no connection
  between the two

* Edit distance should be defined at the beginning of the read mapping section
  not at the end.
