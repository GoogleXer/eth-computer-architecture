\section{Benchmarks}

For the exploration of the cache simulator the programs in
\verb|inputs/benchmark| were used:
\begin{description}
    \item[\texttt{stream}] A 64KB array is written sequentially and read back afterwards
    \item[\texttt{locality}] Used to test temporal and spatial locality
    \item[\texttt{strided}] Strided access to a 64KB array 
\end{description}
Each benchmark starts with a cold cache and the working set size is always 64KB.

\section{Cache Parameters}

For each benchmark the following cache parameters were tested to measure IPC:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cache size from 0 to 256KB (0 is without caching) with a block size of
        4 bytes and associativity 1
    \item Block size from 4 to 2048 bytes with fixed cache size of 32KB and associativity 1 
    \item Associativity from 1 to 512 with cache size 32KB and block size 32 bytes 
\end{itemize}
The differences between each benchmark are discussed for the rest of this section.
