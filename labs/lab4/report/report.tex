The prefetchers in Task 1 and 2 do not perform well on irregular memory requests
because they can detect only a constant stride in an access pattern.
The Markov prefetcher by ?? showed good results on irregular access patterns
so for Task 3 we combine a Markov prefetcher with the stride
prefetcher from Task 1 (or 2 not sure yet).

Design choices different from paper:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Paper uses Markov prefetcher as prefetcher for LLC, we use it for L2
        cache
    \item Paper considers only cache misses because prefetcher is off-chip, we
        consider all memory requests
    \item Paper uses a 1MB Markov table with 32-bit addresses, we have 64-bit
        addresses so the table size was adjusted accordingly
\end{itemize}
